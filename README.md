Geolocation Changes of Clinic Patient Base
=======================

Executive Summary
-------------
A primary care clinic serving Nashville’s uninsured and underserved sees patients that come from more than 80 countries and speak over 70 languages. As their population has expanded and diversified along with the city over the years, Siloam has considered opening satellite locations to better serve their patients. 
They would like to see the geographic movement of their patients since 2011 to see whether their patients’ residencies are in significantly different places. In particular, they would like to see how many patients live along the I-24 corridor and in areas, such as Smyrna/Murfreesboro, who are traveling a significant distance to come to the clinic. Answering these questions will help to justify the need for opening satellite locations to their board of directors.
The data – including home address, language spoken, and year of first visit – will be pulled from the database that stores all information from Siloam’s EHR system, Greenway PrimeSuite. The primary challenges revolve around the patient’s address: it appears that only a patient’s current address is stored and there are a large number that have been inputted incorrectly into the EHR system.

Motivation
-------------
I have worked as a data analyst at the clinic for the last two years. When I previously pursued medicine as a career, I had hoped to someday work for a clinic like Siloam with a mission to serve and provide whole-person care to underserved communities. While I chose not to continue in medicine, I was very excited that my data analytics experience could be used to further their mission. I am also interested in exploring the diversity of underserved communities in Nashville, and to potentially see what effects the city’s growth and change in availability of affordable housing has on this community.

Data Question
-------------
Has the general location of the clinic’s patients as compared to the clinic location in the Melrose neighborhood changed significantly in the last 8 years?
Due to the significant growth of the greater Nashville area and specifically the area around the clinic, I would hypothesize that there is a significant change in where Siloam’s patients live.
